description:  This is a project I started with the soul propurse of learning diffetent web technologies  and talking to a public to better understand myself what I'm talking about and if people  can benefit from it by learning than great.

            This project was fearly easy, because I'm getting better at learning new technologies and picking the right ones for the job intended. 
                    
            I will keep this project going because this is a great way to learn new technologies and by explaining them, I ingrain them in my brain
