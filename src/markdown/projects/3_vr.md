title: Mortgage Calculator
description: After seeing a buch of Mortgage calculators that I didn't like i decided to make my own that gave you some alternatives when you get the result of your calculations because a lot of people don't really know the great advantage that could be getting less years for a loan or making a bigger Downpayment for the house. I used React for this project because I wanted to know how it integrated with
                    WebAssembly which I used for doing the calculations. I did
                    some testing and turns out is much faster doing the
                    calculating with javascript but the WASM module althought
                    slower was more stable.
