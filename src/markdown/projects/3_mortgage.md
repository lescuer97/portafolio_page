title: Vr Store and Reservation Manager
description: This was a front end that I started designing for a business
            but because of our 2020 "best friend" COVID-19 the business
            went under. 
                    
            This is a simple front end where people could do
            reservations for a Virtual Reality session and get their
            appointments there is an admin page where you can vizualize
            and handle this reservations, you can create, edit and erase
            this reservations.
