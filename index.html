          <h5>If you are wondering who I am...</h5>

          <p>
            My name is Leonardo, I'm a 23 years old self tought Developer, from
            Madrid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I was a kid, I grew in a technologist Family that owned a
            telecom company, working in the company I worked from Reparing
            Smartphones and working with VoIP phones i learned alot about
            encryption and software. Later in life when i decided to go to
            university I decided with Tourism, so i left the tech area for a
            while, in the middle of my studies, I started to get interested
            again in tech be cause of all the technology in tourism so I decided
            to start learing programming formally
          </p>
          <p>
            I started reading books and doing courses for learning started with
            simple HTML and CSS and progressed to Javascript and during this
            proccess I also learned the technical side of linux as my main
            operating system and just started practicing and practicing and well
            I have gotten better over time

                    This is the very same page you are looking at, I decided to
                    use vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML. The reason for this is
                    that my learning was primarily focus with framework so I
                    decided to go with the basic option. The actual awesome part
                    of this project is not the Front-end but the back-end, this
                    is done with Rust specifically with actix-web which is a
                    blazing fast web framework. This same web server ended up
                    being used to host my learning recording that are show in
                    this web page.

                    After seeing a buch of Mortgage calculators that I didn't
                    like i decided to make my own that gave you some
                    alternatives when you get the result of your calculations
                    because a lot of people don't really know the great
                    advantage that could be getting less years for a loan or
                    making a bigger Downpayment for the house. I used React for
                    this project because I wanted to know how it integrated with
                    WebAssembly which I used for doing the calculations. I did
                    some testing and turns out is much faster doing the
                    calculating with javascript but the WASM module althought
                    slower was more stable.

                    This was a front end that I started designing for a business
                    but because of our 2020 "best friend" COVID-19 the business
                    went under. <br />
                    This is a simple front end where people could do
                    reservations for a Virtual Reality session and get their
                    appointments there is an admin page where you can vizualize
                    and handle this reservations, you can create, edit and erase
                    this reservations.

                    This is actually a business project that I have with some
                    friends on a nightclub offers handling app. This has gotten
                    slow thanks to COVID-19 but it's still running. On the Web
                    Part, I did pretty much everything with some help from Javi
                    who is a senior developer in a software development company.
                    <br />
                    Because of contract reasons I can't show the code, but I was
                    permitted to get a Demo running. <br />

                    Overall this is the biggest project I have made and is
                    actually sad that I can't show the code.
